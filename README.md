# Flower Type Prediction using Convolutional Neural Network

### Objective: The project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to predict the type of flowers from images.
  Features: 
  Implementation of basic CNN model with 3 Conv2D layers
  Evaluation of model performance using accuracy and ROC-AUC values
  Visualization of ROC curve for the test dataset
  Prediction of flower types for images in the 'CHECK' directory
